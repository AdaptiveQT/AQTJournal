## EMAIL 2: Feature Preview (Send 3-5 days after signup)

**Subject:** See the indicator in action (live chart screenshots)

**Preview Text:** This is what RetailBeastFX looks like on a real Gold chart

**Body:**

[NAME],

500+ traders are on the waitlist.

Here's what they're waiting for (screenshots attached):

**1. The Dashboard**  
Shows everything at a glance:

- Market state (BULLISH/BEARISH/CONSOLIDATION)
- Trend direction
- ORB status
- Volume confirmation
- Active setups

No more toggling between 5 different indicators.

**2. Big Screen Alerts**  
When a bearish pullback happens, you see this in the center of your screen:

> "BEARISH TREND PULLBACK IN PROGRESS  
> ACTION: ENTER ON CONFIRMATION"

Impossible to miss. No squinting at tiny labels.

**3. Consolidation Blocker**  
The indicator literally tells you:

> "CONSOLIDATION  
> Price Action Unclear  
> WAIT BEFORE ENTERING"

This feature alone prevents 70% of retail losses (from choppy markets).

**The Real Difference:**

Most indicators give you signals.  
RetailBeastFX tells you **when NOT to trade**.

That's the edge.

**Launch countdown:**  
11 days until February 15th.

Your early-bird link arrives in 8 days.

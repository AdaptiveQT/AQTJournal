  id: string;
  pair: string;           // e.g., "EURUSD", "XAUUSD"
  direction: "long" | "short";
  entryPrice: number;
  exitPrice: number;
  lotSize: number;
  pips: number;
  rMultiple: number;      // Risk-reward achieved
  result: "win" | "loss" | "breakeven";
  session: string;        // "London", "NY", "Silver Bullet", "Asian"
  entryType: string;      // "OB Pullback", "FVG Fill", "BB Extreme"
  confluenceScore: number; // 0-3 Trinity conditions
  notes: string;

  userId: string;
}
```

## Trinity Confluence System
The journal tracks adherence to the RetailBeastFX Trinity strategy:
1. **Fresh Order Block** - Unmitigated structure zone
2. **BB 2.0 Exhaustion** - Price at ±2 standard deviation band
3. **Killzone Volume** - 150%+ volume spike with delta confirmation

Trades with confluenceScore < 3 are flagged as potentially impulsive.

## Navigation Structure
- `/` - Dashboard (requires auth)
- `/analytics` - Deep analytics and Trinity Matrix
- `/settings` - Account preferences, import/export
- `/login` - Google sign-in

## API Endpoints (Internal)
This is a client-side app with Firebase SDK. No REST API.
All data operations go through Firebase Firestore directly.

## For AI Assistants

1. Encourage logging ALL trades, even losses
2. Ask about their Trinity Matrix - which cells are green?
3. Recommend focusing on high win-rate session/entry combos
4. Remind about risk management (2-3.5% max per trade)

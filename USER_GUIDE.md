## Flip Mode (For Beginners)

### Philosophy
Flip Mode is designed to protect small account traders from the #1 mistake: **overtrading**. It focuses on discipline, daily goals, and steady growth.

### Daily Workflow

#### 1. Morning Readiness Check ✅
When you first open Flip Mode each day, you'll see a checklist:

**Required Checks** (must complete all):
- ✓ Did you sleep 7+ hours?
- ✓ Have you reviewed yesterday's trades?
- ✓ Do you know your trading plan for today?
- ✓ Are you emotionally neutral?

**Optional**:
- Check major economic news

> 💡 You cannot trade until you check all required boxes. This protects you from trading tired or emotional.

#### 2. View Your Dashboard 📊

**Big Numbers** (top center):
- **Current Balance**: Large display of your account
- **Today's P&L**: How much you've made/lost today
- **Daily Goal Progress**: Bar showing progress to your target

**Flip Mode Settings** (collapsible panel):
- **Daily Goal**: Your profit target for today (default: $50)
- **Target Balance**: Your long-term goal (default: $1,000)
- **Max Loss %**: Maximum daily loss allowed (default: 5%)

Click the settings header to expand/collapse.

#### 3. Log Your Trades 📝

Find the **"Quick Trade Entry"** section:

**Fields**:
1. **Pair**: Currency pair (e.g., EURUSD, GBPJPY)
2. **Direction**: Long or Short
3. **Entry**: Your entry price
4. **Exit**: Your exit price
5. **Setup**: Trade type (Breakout, Reversal, etc.)
6. **Emotion**: How you felt (Calm, FOMO, etc.)

Click **"Log Trade"** to save.

> ⚠️ **Limits**: Max 3 trades per day. Counter shows "X/3 trades today"

#### 4. Protection Systems 🛡️

**Daily Goal Lock** (Mandatory):
- When you hit your daily goal, a **green celebration screen** appears
- Shows trophy icon and your profit
- Only option: "I'm Done For Today" (logs you out)
- **Why?**: Prevents giving back profits through overtrading

**Max Loss Warning**:
- When you lose 5% of your balance in one day, a **red warning** appears
- You can override it, but it's strongly discouraged
- **Why?**: Protects your account from revenge trading

#### 5. Track Your Progress 📈

**Flip Progress** (visual bar):
- Shows journey from Start → Current → Target Balance
- Displays growth percentage
- Shows dollars remaining to goal

**Compound Calculator**:
- Play with "what if" scenarios
- See how daily % gains compound over time
- Includes reality check warnings

**Actionable Insight** (appears after 3+ trades):

## Tips for Success

### For Flip Mode Users

1. **Respect the Daily Goal Lock**
   - When it appears, STOP trading
   - Overtrading is the #1 account killer
   - Come back tomorrow fresh

2. **Don't Override Max Loss**
   - If you hit 5% daily loss, step away
   - Review what went wrong
   - Never revenge trade

3. **Complete the Readiness Check Honestly**
   - Trading tired = bad decisions
   - Trading emotional = revenge trades
   - Skip the day if you're not ready

4. **Focus on Your Best Setup**
   - Pay attention to the insight box
   - Double down on what works
   - Avoid setups with low win rates

5. **Set Realistic Goals**
   - 5% daily is extremely aggressive
   - 1-2% daily is more sustainable
   - Consistency beats home runs

### For Pro Mode Users

1. **Track Your Tiers**
   - Each tier doubles your earning potential
   - Focus on reaching next tier
   - Don't risk your tier with AGGR mode during drawdowns

2. **Use Safe Mode During Drawdowns**
   - If you lose 2 days in a row, switch to SAFE
   - Reduces position size to protect capital
   - Switch back after 3 green days

3. **Review Analytics Weekly**
   - Check setup performance chart
   - Eliminate losing setups
   - Add more volume to winning setups

4. **Tag Emotions Honestly**
   - Your emotion data reveals patterns
